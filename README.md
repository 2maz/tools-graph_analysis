# Graph Analysis

This library provides functionality for analyzing graphs and networks.
Its core functionality will come from other graph libraries such as:
 - boost graph: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html
   - header only
   - C++, template-based API
 - snap: http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/
   - autotools based build
 - lemon: http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon
   - cmake based build
   - support of parallel arcs in digraphs, see also: http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/tutorial/a00011.html#sec_digraphs

Further libraries are available, but have not been integrated:
 - igraph: http://igraph.sourceforge.net/
   - C API
 - graph-tool: http://graph-tool.skewed.de/
   - boost graph based, with Python integration
   - autotools based build, very high compilation requirements
 - odgf: http://ogdf.net/doku.php
   - layout algorithms

## Motivation
A number of different graph libraries does exist - as listed above - though they cannot always be compared in a one to one fashion.
This library tries to provide a standard interface while maintaining access to
the particular feature of one library.
This allows to benefit from complementary graph algorithm implementations.
The goal of this library is to maintain a consistent and capable high-level interface abstraction in order to allow graph modeling and analysis.

Hence, the graph analysis library comes with a small framework to design
graph-based UI in QT.

## Examples

### Standard API Usage

```
#include "GraphAnalysis.hpp"
#include "lemon/Graph.hpp"
...
using namespace graph_analysis;

class MyVertex : Vertex
{
public:
    MyVertex(const std::string& attr)
        : mAttribute(attr)
    {}

    std::string getClassName() const { return "MyVertex"; }
    std::string toString() const { return getClassName() + " " + mAttribute; }
protected:
    /// To allow for cloning of graphs using deep copy
    Vertex* getClone() const { return new MyVertex(*this); }
private:
    std::string mAttribute;
};

BaseGraph::Ptr graph = BaseGraph::getInstance(BaseGraph::LEMON_DIRECTED_GRAPH);
Vertex::Ptr v0(new MyVertex());
Vertex::Ptr v1(new MyVertex());

Edge::Ptr e0(new Edge());
e0->setSourceVertex(v0);
e0->setTargetVertex(v1);

graph->add(e0);

int vertexCount = graph->getVertexCount();
int vertexCountInternal = ::lemon::countNodes(graph.raw());

VertexIterator::Ptr vertexIt = graph->getVertexIterator();
while(vertexIt->next())
{
   Vertex::Ptr vertex = vertexIt->current();
   printf("Vertex: %s\n", vertex->toString().c_str());
}

EdgeIterator::Ptr edgeIt = graph->getEdgeIterator();
while(edgeIt->next())
{
   Edge::Ptr edge = edgeIt->current();
   printf("Edge: %s\n", edge->toString().c_str());
}
```

### Graph I/O

Please refer to the detailed description of graph_analysis::io::GraphIO which is part of the doxygen
documentation.

## Installation from GitLab (internal)

Create a new Rock-based installation in a development folder, here called dev.
You can use the default values for the configuration questions.

```
    mkdir dev
    cd dev
    wget http://www.rock-robotics.org/master/autoproj_bootstrap
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap
```


Add the following to autoproj/init.rb:
```
  Autoproj.gitorious_server_configuration('DFKIGIT', 'git.hb.dfki.de', :fallback_to_http => false, :default => 'ssh,ssh')
```


In autoproj/manifest add the respective manifest and add the package to the
layout section:
```
    package_set:
        - dfkigit: rock-dfki/package_set

    layout:
        - tools/graph_analysis
```

In order to speed up the installation process you can opt to add the existing
Debian packages for Rock. To do that, just add the following to the
autoproj/manifest.

```
    package_set:
        - github: rock-core/rock-osdeps-package_set

```

Then you can trigger the installation:
```
$>source env.sh
$>autoproj update
$>autoproj osdeps
$>amake tools/graph_analysis
```

## Installation from GitHub

Create a new Rock-based installation in a development folder, here called dev:
```
    mkdir dev
    cd dev
    wget http://www.rock-robotics.org/master/autoproj_bootstrap
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap
```

In autoproj/manifest add the respective manifest and add the package to the
layout section:
```
    package_set:
        - github: rock-core/rock-package_set

    layout:
        - tools/graph_analysis
```

```
$>source env.sh
$>autoproj update
$>autoproj osdeps
$>amake tools/graph_analysis
```

### Generate the documentation

To see the documentation of this project please do the following after
checkout to generate the doxygen-base documentation:

```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    make doc
```

Open the doxygen documentation with a browser: build/doc/index.html
The doxygen documentation contains all information on how to start
using the library along with the general API documentation.
